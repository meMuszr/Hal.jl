# Hal.jl

Hal.jl aims to provide a lightweight set of tools for programmers to build Machine Learning and Evolutionary Algorithm models in the Julia programming language.

## Motivation

As an AI enthusiast who fell in love with the Julia programming language, I felt it only appropriate to develop a library that would be beneficial both to myself for deepening my knowledge of AI algorithms and the Julia programming language, as well as my fellow Julia developers who might want to use those algorithms in their own projects. Due to the educational nature of this project, the scope of algorithms implemented here will increase with my knowledge. Many of the implementations I plan to make are listed in the "thingstoinclude.txt" file within the Hal project folder, however, if there is something not currently available here, I happily encourage users to contact me and make a request!


## Why [Julia](https://julialang.org/)?

While the AI community has invested heavily in developing an ecosystem around the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language ([Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), etc.), I believe that the [performant](https://julialang.org/benchmarks/) and expressive nature of Julia make it a great addition to the list of technologies to use in one's AI related projects.

## Credits

By far, the most useful sources of information to my learning are Stanford's [cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) and the UCL [course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html) on Reinforcement Learning. Those two are followed very closely by Andrew Trask's [blog](https://iamtrask.github.io/) and Siraj Raval's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A/featured), which are also important sources of information and inspiration to my efforts.
